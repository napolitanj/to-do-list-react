Project Description and features

LIVE DEMO: https://napolitanj.github.io/to-do-list-react/

A more refined version of my previous To Do List app, this time built with React. This task organizer has similar functionality. This app allows a user to create tasks, sort them into folders, and mark them as completed.

Version 1.0

- Any incomplete tasks will always appear in "Active Tasks"
- Creating a folder allows you to select that folder in task creation.
- Any complete tasks will move into the Completed Tasks folder.
- You can permanently delete any custom folders or tasks.
